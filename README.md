## 🔗 **Connect External Repo (AI Model)**
We need to link this repository with **[GDG AI Model](https://github.com/Subhrasameerdash/gdg-codes)**.  
### **Steps to Connect the Model with This App**
1. **Clone the AI Model Repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Subhrasameerdash/gdg-codes.git
```
2. **Integrate the Model with This App**
   - If it’s a **Python API**, we can use `http` requests to connect.  
   - If it’s a **Dart package**, we can add it as a **Git dependency**:
     ```yaml
     dependencies:
       ai_model:
         git:
           url: https://github.com/Subhrasameerdash/gdg-codes.git
     ```

3. **Push the Changes**
```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Integrated AI Model"
git push origin main
```
